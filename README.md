# SnowBattle

Hey guys,
Missed so much things when uploading the game.

Keybindings (UK Keyboard, you need to rebind your keyboard with Windows+Space to play the game smoothly) :

1P : WASD -> Move\newline
     Q    -> Throw a snowball\newline
     E    -> Reload next to the snow piles\newline
     C    -> Crouch\newline
     
2P : TFGH -> Move\newline
     R    -> Throw a snowball\newline
     Y    -> Reload next to the snow piles\newline
     N    -> Crouch\newline
          
3P : IJKL -> Move\newline
     U    -> Throw a snowball\newline
     O    -> Reload next to the snow piles\newline
     .    -> Crouch\newline
          
4P : Arrows       -> Move\newline
     1 (numpad)   -> Throw a snowball\newline
     2 (numpad)   -> Reload next to the snow piles\newline
     0 (numpad)   -> Crouch\newline
     
This project is free to use by any means, as I developped it on my own just to improve my Unity and C#\newline

Also, I wanna credit the sounds and music I used. The music in fight is from Tales of Symphonia, and the sounds like reloading are from a free-to-use mp3 sounds website.
I made the assets on my own.\newline
